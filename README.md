# Audit Reports

## Smart Contracts, Blockchain , DApps Audit Reports

Our thorough analysis framework combines Manual and Automated methods to create a holistic solution for pinpointing vulnerabilities and logic flaws in smart contract code. This multifaceted approach carefully evaluates key aspects of smart contract integrity:

**Security Assessment**: We rigorously assess code security, probing for weaknesses that could lead to malicious attacks or unauthorized access.

**Documentation Validation**: Our analysis goes beyond code examination, confirming its alignment with associated documentation such as whitepapers. This ensures the code accurately mirrors the intended design.

**Gas Consumption Optimization**: We meticulously examine the code to ensure efficient gas usage, following industry best practices to optimize computational processes and minimize resource consumption.

**Code Excellence**: We prioritize readable code that adheres to established best practices, boosting maintainability and reducing the chance of errors or inefficiencies.

Through this comprehensive approach, we provide the confidence to deploy smart contracts, ensuring their security, accuracy, efficiency, and compliance with industry standards.


# Summary

## Why Security Auditing ?

Some smart contracts don't live up to their "smart" reputation. Security poses a significant concern in this domain, particularly highlighted by recent hacks. Seeking an audit from a trusted third party stands as the most insightful method to uncover bugs, vulnerabilities, and security flaws that might lurk unnoticed until the contract goes live. If your smart contract is poised for deployment, this represents the final opportunity to shield your project from potential crypto hacks due to the irreversible nature of these contracts.

## Some common bugs in smart contracts that got funds worth millions of dollars stolen :

- Insecure coding practices often give rise to smart contract vulnerabilities, such as inadequate input validation or mishandling exceptions.

- Flaws in the broader system design can create openings for attacks within smart contracts. For instance, insufficient access controls or intricate interactions among various components can become potential weak points for attackers.

- Mistakes in implementing the intended logic of a smart contract can introduce vulnerabilities, whether they stem from errors in the code or in how the contract interacts with other system elements.

- Robust security controls are imperative for smart contracts to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation. Without these safeguards, vulnerabilities can be exploited, leading to fund theft by attackers.

- Reentrancy attacks represent a vulnerability allowing attackers to repeatedly call a contract's function before the previous call concludes, enabling them to drain the contract's funds, as seen in the Parity MultiSig Wallet hack that resulted in the theft of $31 million worth of Ether.

- Smart contracts making external calls without proper result validation are vulnerable to exploitation. This loophole allows hackers to manipulate the contract's state and abscond with funds.

- Misconfigured functions within smart contracts can be exploited by attackers to steal funds. For instance, the SQUID token scam involved a misconfigured function enabling hackers to steal $3.38 million from investors.
